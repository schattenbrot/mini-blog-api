# Mini Blog API

A basic API for a blog page.

## Used dependencies & Credits

- [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for .env files.
- [Chi-router](https://github.com/go-chi/chi)
- [Validation](https://github.com/go-playground/validator)

## Usage

For testing you can use the provided docker-compose. This will spin up the API along side a mongodb.
The api will then run on port 4000. The db will be run on port 27017.

## Contributing

Even though this project is made for private learning purposes I would never decline recommendations for improvements.

## TODO

- validation
- login
- pagination (might want to revisit later for a "better" response)
- graphql?! why is this a thing?! D:
